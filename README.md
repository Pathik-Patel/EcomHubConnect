Hello everyone,

I'm excited to introduce you to Ecomhub Connect, a project designed to manage multiple ecommerce stores through a single application.

This project is developed for people who own multiple ecommerce stores, offering them a centralized platform for efficient store management. Within the application, users can access their stores and view comprehensive order data. They have the flexibility to filter orders based on various parameters such as timeframes—whether it's this month, the past three or six months—and even by order status. This granular filtering ensures users can focus on the data most relevant to their needs.

Moreover, It provides valuable insights, including total sales, order volumes, top-selling items, and regional sales distribution. This empowers users to make informed decisions to optimize their business strategies.
One of the standout features is the predictive analytics module. Leveraging machine learning techniques, this application forecasts future sales based on historical data, considering trends, seasonality, and other factors. This enables users to anticipate demand, plan inventory, and set realistic sales targets effectively.

To create this project, I have used React for frontend, Spring Boot Java for Backend, Python for forecasting part, and SQL server for database. I have used complex queries as well as database indexing for faster retrieval of data. For the security purpose, i am using Spring Security.
